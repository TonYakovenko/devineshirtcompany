                <h2 class="heading2">Art Guidelines</h2>
                <p>
                    If you want to supply your own ‘print ready’ artwork, please refer to these Art Guidelines for more info.<br><br>

                    Artwork is considered “print ready” when it can be used for screen printing without the need for any adjustments that may possibly incur added fees or result in delays.<br>

                    When submitting digital art files to Devine Shirt Company please refer to the below guidelines. If you have any questions email us at info@devineshirtcompany.ca.<br><br>

                    <b>Vector Art:</b><br>

                    Vector artwork files must be saved up to Adobe Illustrator® CS6 (.ai, .eps, .pdf). All fonts must be converted to curves or outlines to prevent font substitutions. Include a proof of your design with color designations to confirm that no font substitutions have occurred. All objects must have at least a 1 pt line thickness to guarantee proper print quality. If the vector file contains any placed raster images, these images must meet or exceed our requirements for resolution when rendered at 100% of the final imprint size. Also, they must be submitted with the original vector file.<br><br>

                    <b>Programs:</b><br>

                    We will accept files saved in Adobe Illustrator® CS6 providing that all text is converted to curves or outlines. We will also accept files saved in Adobe Photoshop®<br>

                    CS6 at 100% of final print size with a resolution of at least 220ppi. Jpegs are most often useless if they are taken from the internet, but can be replicated for use in screen-printing at an fee of $25.<br><br>

                    <b>Fonts:</b><br>

                    For vector art, text must be converted to paths, curves, or outlines. The text then becomes an object and can no longer be edited as text.<br><br>

                    <b>Line Thickness:</b><br>

                    All design elements should contain a line thickness of at least 1pt. Failure to assign a 1 pt line thickness to all objects may compromise the final imprint quality.<br><br>

                    <b>Spot Colors:</b><br>

                    Please specify color via PMS spot color designations to each object, text, or layer in your design. Due to hardware and software color calibration differences, this will allow the best color matching possible. We primarily use the Pantone Coated library. If you need more information about the Pantone Matching system please visit www.pantone.com<br><br>

                    <b>Proofs:</b><br>

                    When creating designs for our customers, proofs are a way of assuring that we have set your type correctly and that all of the design elements are placed according to your requirements. A proof will be sent to your email address provided that can be approved with a simple reply. We will not start on any project until your proof has been approved.<br><br>

                    Please email info@devineshirtcompany.ca with any questions you may have regarding digital art.<br><br>

                        Scott at Devine was awesome!  the shirts i had him print on were a variety of different sizes and style so no easy task.  he got them done on time and they all looked great.  he had a great suggestion for colours.  i'll definitely work with him again
